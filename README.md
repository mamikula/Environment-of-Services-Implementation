## Introduction

[CAST AI](https://cast.ai/) is a cloud optimization platform that cuts cloud bills in half for AWS,
Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure customers who use the cloudnative technology of Kubernetes. Powered by AI, it analyzes multiple data
points to find an optimal cost-performance ratio.

### Goal of the project 

The aim of this project is to construct and perform a simple case study that would allow for familiarization with CAST.AI technology, which is an all-in-one platform for Kubernetes automation, optimization, security, and cost management.

## 2. Theoretical background/technology stack

CAST AI is an all-in-one platform for Kubernetes automation, optimization, security, and cost management. It abstracts layers of provider-specific technical complexity, so you can manage Kubernetes operations on all three major cloud providers with ease.

The platform comes with cost monitoring for real-time and longer-period cost reports at the cluster, namespace, and workload level. It also offers cost optimization suggestions and automatic optimization using autoscaling, spot instance automation, bin packing, and other features.

At the same time, CAST AI also checks your cluster security configuration for misconfigurations and any potential vulnerabilities and automatically prioritizes the fixes to improve your security posture. It also lets you scan your cluster against industry standards, incl. CIS Benchmarks and many more.
